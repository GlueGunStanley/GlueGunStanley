<br>
Howdy! I'm Stanley. 👨‍💻  <br/>
<br>
I'm a passionate developer with a strong focus on the FiveM community. <br/>
My journey started in 2018, creating resources for the FiveM platform. 🎮 <br/>
Since then, I've been diving deep into coding, creating cool things, and learning something new every now and then. 🌱 <br/>
<br>
While you'll find a few of my projects here on GitHub, most of my work remains private. 🔒 <br/>
That said, the public projects here offer a glimpse into the work I enjoy doing — though not the full picture! <br/>
<br>
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me: <br/>
💦 Huffing spray paint <br/>
🤝 Annoying the hell out of the few friends that I have <br/>
🎨 Ocassionaly learning new skills that may or may not actually be useful <br/>
🛠️ Working on side projects that will probably never see the light of day <br/>
<br>
If you're here to explore my work, feel free to check out some of my repositories. <br/>
If you're weird and you really want to, you can also check out some of my GitHub stats. <br/>
